# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Legacy AmiFTP versions use major.revision numbering (e.g. 1.11 > 1.1, 1.201 > 1.20).

## [AmiFTP 2 alpha 2] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Build: GNUmakefile for bebbo/amiga-gcc cross-compiler. AmiFTP now builds from a Linux or macOS host without requiring SAS/C. Produces a HUNK-format binary compatible with AmigaOS 3.2.
- Compatibility: `gcc_compat.c` provides SAS/C-specific runtime functions (`strmfp`, `stcgfn`, `geta4`, `getfa`, `getdfs`, `_ProgramName`, `__WBenchMsg`) and defines `ARexxBase = NULL` to prevent the libstubs OS 3.5-era arexx.library opener from linking in.
- Compatibility: `inc/reaction_compat.h` re-provides varargs gadget node allocation macros (`AllocListBrowserNode`, `AllocChooserNode`, etc.) disabled by the `-DNO_INLINE_STDARG` flag required for GCC builds.

### Fixed
- bsdsocket.library: Removed `setsockopt(SO_OOBINLINE)` and `setsockopt(SO_KEEPALIVE)` from `ftp_hookup()` and `dataconn()`. On OS 3.2 bsdsocket (Roadshow), both options block indefinitely instead of returning an error.
- bsdsocket.library: `try_pasv()` now uses a non-blocking connect with a WaitSelect loop, matching the approach already used in `ftp_hookup()`. On OS 3.2 bsdsocket, `tcp_connect()` always returns EINPROGRESS immediately even on fast connections.
- bsdsocket.library: `sgetc()` WaitSelect call now includes at least one Intuition window signal alongside `SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C`. On OS 3.2 bsdsocket, WaitSelect ignores the timeval timeout when the signal mask contains only `SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C`, causing an indefinite stall.
- bsdsocket.library: `sgetc()` passes `nfds=32` to WaitSelect rather than `sock+1`, matching the `empty()` helper and avoiding stalls with low socket descriptor values.
- MainWindow: added NULL guard after `LockPubScreen` fallback to avoid crash when no screen is available.

## [AmiFTP 2 alpha 1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- FTP: Support for passive data connections (`PASV`) with active (`PORT`) fallback for better compatibility with NAT and firewalled environments.
- FTP: Support for extended passive/active commands (`EPSV`/`EPRT`) to prepare for IPv6 and modern server setups.
- FTP: Capability discovery via `FEAT` (e.g. `SIZE`, `MDTM`, `EPSV`, `PASV`, `UTF8`) to drive conditional use of optional protocol features.
- workbench.library v45: launch viewer in Workbench mode via `OpenWorkbenchObject()` when available.
- Default Sitelist entries for Aminet and EAB.

### Changed
- Socket I/O: Align `bsdsocket.library` usage with the Roadshow SDK by correctly initialising `struct sockaddr_in` (including `sin_len`) before `connect()` and related calls.
- Socket I/O: Clarified and standardised handling of network byte order for ports, ensuring all `sin_port` assignments use `htons()` when values originate from URLs or user input.
- FTP: Prefer PASV/EPSV data connections by default when available, retaining a configurable fallback to legacy PORT mode.
- FTP: Improved parsing of `150` replies and optional use of `SIZE`/`MDTM` replies (`213`) for transfer progress, resume support, and timestamp handling.
- FTP: Centralised reply code classification (1xx/2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx) to simplify and standardise error handling paths.
- GUI: Improved window title and screen title information
- Build: Is now compatible with NDK 3.2 R4
- MainWindow: default size 70% of screen when no saved setting exists.
- FTP URL parsing: case-insensitive handling of `ftp://` protocol.
- Log messages follow syslog-style conventions; improved error logging around DOS I/O failures using `IoErr()`.
- Default config when no prefs file exists: buttons and toolbar visible (`mp_ShowButtons` / `mp_ShowToolBar` TRUE).

### Fixed
- Socket I/O: Ensured type correctness for length arguments (`socklen_t` and related pointers) in `getpeername()`, `getsockname()`, `bind()`, `accept()`, and `setsockopt()` calls to match SDK prototypes.
- FTP: Hardened line-oriented parsing and buffer handling in `getreply()`, directory listing (`next_remote_line()`), and related helpers with strict bounds checks and guaranteed NUL termination.
- FTP: Replaced unsafe `vsprintf()` usage in FTP command construction with bounded formatting to avoid buffer overflows on long inputs.
- FTP: Corrected or removed unsafe `s_fgets()` behaviour (double increment, incorrect newline detection); LIST/NLST line reads bounded.
- FTP: Bounded writes to `response_line` and `str_buf` for protection against long server lines and oversized commands.
- FTP: Clarified and fixed control/data connection state transitions, timeouts, and cleanup after errors or `ABOR` so that sockets and internal state remain consistent.
- Connect window: now shows URL host when connecting via URL, not last site in list (bugreports/mh.txt).
- Help file location corrected.
- Transfer abort handling kept responsive via the transfer window.
- Dirlist: do not add 0-byte files with 255-character name (listbrowser display bug); NULL `name` check in `add_direntry()`.
- Upload: remote path for STOR is now `remote/FilePart(entry->name)` when a remote directory is set, avoiding creation of unwanted directories (remotepath/dirtree fix).
- UploadFile: NULL checks for list entry and `entry->name`; check `malloc` result for ADT rem buffer.
- Hotlist crash when adding a new entry: SiteWindow cursor-up/cursor-down and double-click guard against NULL `sn` from listbrowser UserData; `flags=0UL` instead of `flags=NULL`; `retnode` checked before use.
- Window position reset when only hotlist changed: CloseMainWindow updates MainPrefs from the window when ConfigChanged so exit saves the correct position.
- Transferwindow in aminet/ADT mode: OpenTransferWindow no longer assumes MainWindow is non-NULL; positions transfer window at screen center when main window is not open.
- Directory path breadcrumbs chooser gadget misread Tail node of list node and added one more list entry leading to garbage text appaearing in chooser popup.

### Removed
- AsyncIO dependency; AmigaDOS I/O used directly instead.
- AS225 / socket.library support; single binary uses bsdsocket.library only.
- reqtools.library dependency; requesters and UI use ASL/ReAction/Intuition instead via rtasl.lib

### Security
- FTP: Reduced risk from malicious or malformed server replies by adding strict buffer limits and more defensive reply parsing throughout the control and data paths.
- FTP: Avoided accidental exposure of credentials or sensitive data in logs by tightening command/response handling and documenting best practices for future FTPS work.
